Karaoke Anywhere

# How to set up
Copy all files to a web server. If you don't have a web server, you can copy them to your Dropbox Public folder. Get the link of index.html from the server and you are all set.

# How to user
Visit index.html from any device, enter a room name (be creative, don't get into other's room), and choose "Controller" or "Player".

Use Player if you are casting that device to the TV (or use that device directly as the karaoke screen). Use one Player only as multiple player mode is not tested.

Use Controller from your mobile device as remote controls to choose songs and adjust the playlist.
